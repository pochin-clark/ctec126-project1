## Student Responsibilities and Expectations

From the course syllabus:

> Academic and intellectual honesty are the only acceptable behaviors. You are expected to do your own work on assignments, quizzes, and projects. Lack of ethical behavior will result in receiving no credit on an activity, assignment or test, and may result in a final grade of "F" and/or dismissal from the course.

### What the page must look like

### Displaying Random Quotes

- Directly below the **News from the Penguin Nation** is where random quotes from the quotes array should be displayed. The quotes should be switched out every 15 seconds. Use setInterval() for this.

### Displaying the Featured Student

### Make the Logo Stop all of the Intervals
